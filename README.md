# CIS4340 HW03 Project Summary

## Scraper Choice
I chose to use BeautifulSoup as my scraping tool. I selected it over Scrapy because it offers more flexibility for projects that require highly customized parsing logic. Since my goal was to extract structured data from a single Wikipedia page with multiple irregular HTML tables, where I'd have to reformat some data and calculate columns, BeautifulSoup provided the direct access I needed to manipulate the tags and handle the inconsistencies between tables.

I used requests to retrieve the page and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content. Overall, it took about an hour to set up the initial extraction logic and another few hours to get the data in the precise format I needed.

## Prompts Used
When making the prompts, I tried to include every step from the manually coded web scraping, spelling out the columns that need to be made, formatting changes, order of variables, etc. I also tried to keep the wording very similar from prompt to prompt, assuming that if it worked well for one program, a similar structure and dialog would allow it to work well for another prompt. Here are the prompts I used:
- *AI F9 Only:* Extract all data from all the tables on the page, with engine numbers from B001 to B1089. Create a column flight_type that extracts the first two characters from flight_number (always "F9" or "FH"). Filter for only "F9" in this column. Format launch data as YYYY-MM-DD (Currently DD MMMM YYYY, or 'text' YYYY). Create a column block_type based on engine_number, where Block 1 is B0001-B0007, Block 1.1 is B1001 to B1018, Block 4 is B1019 to B1045, Block 5 is B1046 to B1089. Put columns in this order: engine number, block type, flight number, flight type, launch date, launch pad, landing location, turnaround time, engine status, number of launches.
- *AI FH Only:* Extract all data from all the tables on the page, with engine numbers from B001 to B1089. Create a column flight_type that extracts the first two characters from flight_number (always "F9" or "FH"). Filter for only "FH" in this column. Format launch data as YYYY-MM-DD (Currently DD MMMM YYYY, or 'text' YYYY). Create a column block_type based on engine_number, where Block 1 is B0001-B0007, Block 1.1 is B1001 to B1018, Block 4 is B1019 to B1045, Block 5 is B1046 to B1089. Put columns in this order: engine number, block type, flight number, flight type, launch date, launch pad, landing location, turnaround time, engine status, number of launches.
- *AI FH Pairs:* Extract all data from all the tables on the page, with engine numbers from B001 to B1089. Create a column flight_type that extracts the first two characters from flight_number (always "F9" or "FH"). Filter for only "FH" in this column. Format launch data as YYYY-MM-DD (Currently DD MMMM YYYY, or 'text' YYYY). Create a column block_type based on engine_number, where Block 1 is B0001-B0007, Block 1.1 is B1001 to B1018, Block 4 is B1019 to B1045, Block 5 is B1046 to B1089. Filter on block type column to just Block 5. Only include values where there are three of the same launch data with the same flight number. Put columns in this order: engine number, block type, flight number, flight type, launch date, launch pad, landing location, turnaround time, engine status, number of launches.
- *AI B1 Only:* Extract all data from the first table on the page. Create a column flight_type that extracts the first two characters from flight_number. Format launch data as YYYY-MM-DD (Currently DD MMMM YYYY, or 'text' YYYY). Create a column block_type based off first column where B0001 to B1007 are Block 1 and B1001 to B1018 are Block 1.1.Put columns in this order: engine number, block type, flight number, flight type, launch date, launch pad, landing location, engine status.
- *AI B4 Only:* Extract all data from the page, but only include engine numbers (rows where column S/N[a] values are from B1019 to B1045). Create a column flight_type that extracts the first two characters from flight_number. Format launch data as YYYY-MM-DD (Currently DD MMMM YYYY, or 'text' YYYY). Create a column block_type based and make every value Block 4 (B1019 to B1045). Make a column for number of launches that counts every time an engine name is used to keep track of number of launches. Put columns in this order: engine number, block type, flight number, flight type, launch date, launch pad, landing location, turnaround time, engine status, number of launches.
- *AI B5 Only:* Extract all data from the last two tables on the page, where engine numbers (column S/N[a]) are from B1046 to B1089. Create a column flight_type that extracts the first two characters from flight_number. Format launch data as YYYY-MM-DD (Currently DD MMMM YYYY, or 'text' YYYY). Create a column block_type based and make every value Block 5 (engine numbers B1046 to B1089). Put columns in this order: engine number, block type, flight number, flight type, launch date, launch pad, landing location, turnaround time, engine status, number of launches.
- *aiLongestTurnaround:* Extract all data from all the tables on the page, with engine numbers from B001 to B1089. Create a column flight_type that extracts the first two characters from flight_number (always "F9" or "FH"). Format launch data as YYYY-MM-DD (Currently DD MMMM YYYY, or 'text' YYYY). Create a column block_type based on engine_number, where Block 1 is B0001-B0007, Block 1.1 is B1001 to B1018, Block 4 is B1019 to B1045, Block 5 is B1046 to B1089. Filter on block type column to just Block 4 and Block 5. Include only the row where turnaround time has the greatest (max) value. Put columns in this order: engine number, block type, flight number, flight type, launch date, launch pad, landing location, turnaround time, engine status, number of launches.

## Strategy Employed

## Python Development Tools Used
I developed this project using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my primary IDE. I used the built-in terminal in VS Code for testing the script, and I added logging and exception handling to make debugging easier. For quick CSV previews, I redirected the script output to files.

## Plan for Developing Functions

## Difficulties
I faced a number of difficulties while conducting this project:
- Setting up BeautifulSoup. I had never used this tool before so it took me a while to get used to it.
- Dealing with different formats. It took me a long time to figure out how I could parse different tables that had different columns and didn't line up exactly.
- Getting the right information with Scrap Graph AI. I had a lot of trouble attempting to get the AI tool to pull the data I needed. It was good at formatting and creating columns as needed, but just struggled to extract the right rows.
